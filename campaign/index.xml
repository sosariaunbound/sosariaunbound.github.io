      <description>Introduction It&amp;rsquo;s been over 700 years since The Avatar, shielded by the Barrier of LIght, cast the Armageddon spell and fused with The Guardian and neutralized the evil power that had corrupted the land. Lord British, seeing the land of Sosaria was on the mend has left the lands on a temporal jaunt across space-time to allow the lands ot heal.
After the great cataclysm, Britannia is now whole again and the people ahve been rebuilding for some time.</description>
