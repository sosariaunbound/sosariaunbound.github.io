# Jacob Chenaniah, Neophyte Assassin 

</center>

Jacob Chenaniah was born into an impoverished family on the edge of Minoc in the year 693 of the last sighting of his majesty Lord British. Being that Minoc is a mining town, the young Jacob felt stifled by the rigamarole of daily life in the simplest form as he carried iron and other ores to and from the mines to the forges. When he was enrolled into the rudimentary school system he immediately excelled, and was found to have a particular affinity with the alchemical school. This lead to the Headmaster recommending Jacob be sent to study under one of the permiere alchemists in the land in Moonglow.

Upon his arrival to Moonglow, he was taken in by the Grandmaster Alchemist Isabel "Izzy" Celora.
