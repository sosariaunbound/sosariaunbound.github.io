# Introduction

It's been over 700 years since The Avatar, shielded by the _Barrier of LIght_, cast the _Armageddon_ spell and fused with The Guardian and neutralized the evil power that had corrupted the land. Lord British, seeing the land of Sosaria was on the mend has left the lands on a temporal jaunt across space-time to allow the lands ot heal.

After the great cataclysm, Britannia is now whole again and the people ahve been rebuilding for some time. Stories of The Avatar, The Cataclysm, and Lord British's embodiment of The Virtues but are seen as nothing more than a math, a legend, rather than history. Castle Britannia is till maintained to this day, kept ever-ready in case Lord British should return to resupon his throne once more.

Not all has been easy for the people of Britannia though.There have been famines, skirmishes amongst city-states, and still grotesque creatures have been seen roaming the lands once more. The bands of robed magic users wielding massive halberdss still traverse the lands robbing, looting, and thieving. Normalcy in all things seems to have settle on much of the lands, and the dead have b egun to rise in the Britain Graveyard, with many speculating a liche has risen from the bowels of Deceit to sow discord throughout the land.
